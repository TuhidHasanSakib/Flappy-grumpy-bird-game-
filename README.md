# 🐦 Flappy Grumpy Bird Game

Welcome to **Flappy Grumpy Bird**, a fun and engaging Java-based game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird! Developed as a creative project by **Thuhid Hasan Sakib** at Daffodil International University, this game challenges players to navigate a bird through a series of pipes using simple keyboard controls. Built with Java Swing and AWT, it offers a nostalgic arcade experience with a vibrant graphical interface. 🚀

## 📖 About the Project

Flappy Grumpy Bird is a Java application that simulates the iconic Flappy Bird gameplay. Players control a bird that must avoid colliding with pipes by timing their jumps correctly. The game features a start screen, dynamic pipe generation, collision detection, and a scoring system, all rendered in a colorful 360x640 pixel window. It’s a great example of event-driven programming, game loops, and GUI development in Java.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Start Screen**: Begin the game with a stylish "Start" button featuring hover animations.
- **Bird Navigation**: Press the spacebar to make the bird jump and avoid obstacles.
- **Dynamic Pipes**: Randomly generated top and bottom pipes create a challenging environment.
- **Score Tracking**: Earn points for each pair of pipes successfully passed.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays your final score when the bird collides with a pipe or falls off-screen.
- **Restart Functionality**: Press the spacebar after a game over to reset and play again.
- **Smooth Animations**: 60 FPS game loop for fluid motion and responsive controls.
- **Custom Graphics**: Includes background, bird, and pipe images for an immersive experience.
- **Collision Detection**: Precise checks for bird-pipe and bird-ground collisions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust input handling ensures a seamless player experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language for game logic and structure.
- **Swing & AWT**: For creating the graphical user interface and handling events.
- **ImageIcon**: Loads custom images for the background, bird, and pipes.
- **Timer**: Manages the game loop and pipe generation timing.
- **KeyListener & ActionListener**: Handles keyboard input and button interactions.
- **Java Random**: Generates random pipe positions for varied gameplay.

## 🔒 Developer Notes

- **Image Resources**: Ensure the following image files are in the project’s resource directory:
  - `flappybirdbg.png` (background)
  - `Frame-2.gif` (bird)
  - `toppipe.png` (top pipe)
  - `bottompipe.png` (bottom pipe)
- **Font**: The game uses the "hooge 05_53" font for score display. Ensure it’s available or fallback to a default font.
- **Execution**: Run `App.java` to launch the game. The window is non-resizable and centered on the screen.

## 📌 Limitations

- **Single-Player Only**: No multiplayer or networked gameplay.
- **Fixed Window Size**: The game runs at a fixed 360x640 resolution.
- **Local Resources**: Requires image files to be present locally; no dynamic loading.
- **No Sound**: Currently lacks audio effects or background music.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for jumps, collisions, and background music.
- Implement a high-score system with persistent storage.
- Introduce difficulty levels or adjustable pipe gaps.
- Enhance graphics with animated sprites or varied backgrounds.
- Support resizable windows or full-screen mode.
